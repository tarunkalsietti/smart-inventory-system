Title
# Smart Inventory Reservation System


Problem Overview

This project implements a concurrency-safe inventory reservation system designed for high-traffic scenarios such as flash sales. The system ensures inventory is never oversold, abandoned carts do not block stock permanently, and duplicate requests do not cause inconsistent state.
